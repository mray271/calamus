# Relativistic Clock Drift: From Mercury to Proxima Centauri b

**Generated:** 2026-07-04

---

## Overview

Clocks on different planets run at slightly different rates than on Earth due to two relativistic effects:

- **Gravitational time dilation (GR):** Deeper in a gravitational well → slower clock. Contributions come from the Sun's gravity at the orbital distance *and* the planet's own surface gravity.
- **Velocity time dilation (SR):** Faster movement → slower clock. Orbital speed around the Sun is the main contributor.

The combined fractional rate difference (planet vs. Earth) is:

```
Δ(dτ/dt) = [(-GM_sun/r_orbit - v_orbit²/2 - GM_planet/R_planet)
            - (-GM_sun/r_earth - v_earth²/2 - GM_earth/R_earth)] / c²
```

Multiplied by 10⁹ gives **nanoseconds per second (ns/s)**.

For **Proxima Centauri b**, the reference frame is extended to account for Proxima Centauri's own velocity relative to the Sun (≈32.5 km/s), which adds a significant SR time dilation term:

**Positive** = clock runs *faster* than Earth's.  
**Negative** = clock runs *slower* than Earth's.

## Notable Results

- **Mercury** has the slowest clocks in the solar system (among the 8 planets + Oort Cloud sampled): it is close to the Sun *and* moves fastest in its orbit. Its clock loses exactly **1 day** relative to Earth over ≈120,000 years.

- **Jupiter** runs *slower* than Earth despite being far from the Sun, because its enormous surface gravity (−19.7 ns/s) overwhelms the benefit of its greater orbital distance.

- **Uranus and Neptune** run the fastest among the 8 planets (≈+12 ns/s), gaining roughly half a day on Earth every 120,000 years.

- **Oort Cloud planetesimal** (≈50,000 AU) runs even faster (+15.5 ns/s) because it is so far from the Sun's gravitational well and moves at only ≈133 m/s. Its tiny surface gravity (≈10 km radius, 500 kg/m³) is negligible.

- **Proxima Centauri b** has the slowest clock in this table (−28.4 ns/s), losing **1.25 days** relative to Earth over 120,000 years. Three factors compound: Proxima Centauri's deep gravitational well at the planet's tight 0.0485 AU orbit, a fast orbital speed (≈47 km/s), and the entire Proxima system moving at ≈32.5 km/s relative to the Sun.

¹ Proxima Centauri gravity replaces Solar gravity as the dominant potential well.  
² Orbital KE + stellar velocity SR term combined.
